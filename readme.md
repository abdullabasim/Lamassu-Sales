The Lamuss Accounting System is a computer-based system that collects, stores, and processes financial and accounting data for decision-making purposes. This system helps track accounting activities through information technology resources, and it consists of two servers: a private server and a public server. The data is stored in the private server, and every day, it updates the public server. The system also contains a permission system, which ensures that only authorized users can access specific data and functions within the system. The permission system helps maintain the confidentiality and security of the financial and accounting data stored in the Lamuss Accounting System. This system is designed to be reliable and efficient, providing decision-makers with accurate and up-to-date information for effective financial planning and management. The private server acts as the primary source of information and is responsible for storing all data and information related to financial and accounting activities. The public server, on the other hand, serves as a secondary source of information and is responsible for disseminating information to authorized users. With the Lamuss Accounting System, businesses can streamline their accounting processes, save time and resources, and make informed decisions based on accurate and reliable financial and accounting data.
