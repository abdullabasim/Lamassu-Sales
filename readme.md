# Sales System

The Sales System is a PHP Laravel application designed to collect, store, and process financial and accounting data for decision-making purposes. It provides a computer-based solution that enables efficient tracking of accounting activities using information technology resources. The system consists of two servers: a private server and a public server, each serving a specific purpose in the data management process.

## System Architecture

The Sales System architecture includes the following components:

1. **Private Server**: The private server acts as the primary source of information and is responsible for collecting, storing, and processing financial and accounting data. It securely stores all data and information related to accounting activities, ensuring the confidentiality and security of sensitive information.

2. **Public Server**: The public server serves as a secondary source of information and is responsible for updating and disseminating data to authorized users. It receives updated data from the private server on a regular basis to ensure that users have access to the most up-to-date information.

3. **Permission System**: The system incorporates a permission system that regulates user access to specific data and functions. Only authorized users with appropriate permissions can access and manipulate the financial and accounting data within the system. This ensures the integrity and security of the data and prevents unauthorized access.

## Key Features

- **Reliable Data Storage**: The private server securely stores all financial and accounting data, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

- **Regular Updates**: The private server updates the public server regularly, ensuring that authorized users have access to the latest information.

- **Permission Management**: The system includes a permission system that controls user access to specific data and functions, enhancing data security and confidentiality.

- **Efficient Decision-Making**: The Sales System provides decision-makers with accurate and up-to-date financial and accounting data for effective financial planning and management.

## Usage

1. Set up the Laravel application environment by installing the necessary dependencies and configuring the database connection.

2. Configure the private server and public server to establish a secure and reliable data transfer mechanism.

4. Deploy the Sales System to a web server or a local development environment.

5. Access the system through the provided user interface and perform accounting activities, such as entering sales data, managing invoices, and generating financial reports.

6. Regularly update the public server with the latest data from the private server to ensure users have access to up-to-date information.
